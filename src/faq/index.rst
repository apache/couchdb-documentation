What does "Couch" mean?
-----------------------

"Couch" is an acronym which stands for **C**\ luster **O**\ f **U**\ nreliable
**C**\ ommodity **H**\ ardware. This is a statement of Couch's long-term goal of
massive scalability and high reliability on fault-prone hardware. The
distributed nature and flat address space of the database will enable node
partitioning for storage scalability (with a map/reduce style query facility)
and clustering for reliability and fault tolerance.
