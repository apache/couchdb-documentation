Replication Operation
=====================

The aim of the replication is that at the end of the process, all active
documents on the source database are also in the destination database and all
documents that were deleted in the source databases are also deleted (if they
exist) on the destination database.

Replication can be described as either push or pull replication:

- *Pull replication* is where the ``source`` is the remote CouchDB instance,
  and the ``target`` is the local database.

  Pull replication is the most useful solution to use if your source database
  has a permanent IP address, and your destination (local) database may have a
  dynamically assigned IP address (for example, through DHCP). This is
  particularly important if you are replicating to a mobile or other device
  from a central server.

- *Push replication* is where the ``source`` is a local database, and
  ``target`` is a remote database.

Specifying the Source and Target Database
=========================================

You must use the URL specification of the CouchDB database if you want to
perform replication in either of the following two situations:

- Replication with a remote database (i.e. another instance of CouchDB on the
  same host, or a different host)

- Replication with a database that requires authentication

For example, to request replication between a database local to the CouchDB
instance to which you send the request, and a remote database you might use the
following request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://coucdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

In all cases, the requested databases in the ``source`` and ``target``
specification must exist. If they do not, an error will be returned within the
JSON object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "error" : "db_not_found"
        "reason" : "could not open http://couchdb-remote:5984/ol1ka/",
    }

You can create the target database (providing your user credentials allow it)
by adding the ``create_target`` field to the request object:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "create_target" : true
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

The ``create_target`` field is not destructive. If the database already
exists, the replication proceeds as normal.

Single Replication
==================

You can request replication of a database so that the two databases can be
synchronized. By default, the replication process occurs one time and
synchronizes the two databases together. For example, you can request a single
synchronization between two databases by supplying the ``source`` and
``target`` fields within the request JSON content.

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "recipes-snapshot",
    }

In the above example, the databases ``recipes`` and ``recipes-snapshot`` will
be synchronized. These databases are local to the CouchDB instance where the
request was made. The response will be a JSON structure containing the success
(or failure) of the synchronization process, and statistics about the process:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "ok" : true,
        "history" : [
            {
                "docs_read" : 1000,
                "session_id" : "52c2370f5027043d286daca4de247db0",
                "recorded_seq" : 1000,
                "end_last_seq" : 1000,
                "doc_write_failures" : 0,
                "start_time" : "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:24:13 GMT",
                "start_last_seq" : 0,
                "end_time" : "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:24:14 GMT",
                "missing_checked" : 0,
                "docs_written" : 1000,
                "missing_found" : 1000
            }
        ],
        "session_id" : "52c2370f5027043d286daca4de247db0",
        "source_last_seq" : 1000
    }

Continuous Replication
======================

Synchronization of a database with the previously noted methods happens only
once, at the time the replicate request is made. To have the target database
permanently replicated from the source, you must set the ``continuous`` field
of the JSON object within the request to true.

With continuous replication changes in the source database are replicated to
the target database in perpetuity until you specifically request that
replication ceases.

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "continuous" : true
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

Changes will be replicated between the two databases as long as a network
connection is available between the two instances.

.. note::
    Two keep two databases synchronized with each other, you need to set
    replication in both directions; that is, you must replicate from ``source``
    to ``target``, and separately from ``target`` to ``source``.

Canceling Continuous Replication
================================

You can cancel continuous replication by adding the ``cancel`` field to the
JSON request object and setting the value to true. Note that the structure of
the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to
be honoured. For example, if you requested continuous replication, the
cancellation request must also contain the ``continuous`` field.

For example, the replication request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
        "create_target" : true,
        "continuous" : true
    }

Must be canceled using the request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "cancel" : true,
        "continuous" : true
        "create_target" : true,
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

Requesting cancellation of a replication that does not exist results in a 404
error.

You can also access individual statistics by quoting the statistics sections
and statistic ID as part of the URL path. For example, to get the
``request_time`` statistics, you can use:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /_stats/couchdb/request_time HTTP/1.1

This returns an entire statistics object, as with the full request, but
containing only the request individual statistic. Hence, the returned structure
is as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {

The UUID type is determined by the :config:option:`UUID algorithm
<uuids/algorithm>` setting in the CouchDB configuration.

The UUID type may be changed at any time through the
:ref:`Configuration API <api/config/section/key>`. For example, the UUID type
could be changed to ``random`` by sending this HTTP request:

.. code-block:: http

    PUT http://couchdb:5984/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/uuids/algorithm HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: */*

    "random"

You can verify the change by obtaining a list of UUIDs:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "uuids" : [
            "031aad7b469956cf2826fcb2a9260492",
