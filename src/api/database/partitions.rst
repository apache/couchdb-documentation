.. _api/db/_partition:

Ordinarily, the documents inside a database are arbitrarily assigned
into a shard range. This arbitrary assignment has an adverse affect on query performance
because it is then necessary to contact every shard range to answer each query (it
is not possible to know, a priori, which shard ranges have no matches).

A partitioned database (created with ``?partitioned=true``) provides a
solution to this predicament if your use case is suitable. All documents within a
partitioned database have a special format for their document IDs.

.. code-block:: text

    partition:id

Where both ``partition`` and ``id`` adhere to the CouchDB document ID
restrictions.

Documents with the same ``partition`` value are placed in the same shard
range with one another. You must choose your ``partition`` values with
care, the scalability and performance of this feature critically
depends on it. Ideally, you have a natural choice in your application
(user name or account name, for example) that partitions your data
such that each partition can be queried meaningfully.
