Theory
======

Before we move on, we need some theory.

As you see in ``etc/default.ini`` there is a section called [cluster]

.. code-block:: text

    [cluster]
    q=8
    n=3

* ``q`` - The number of shards.
* ``n`` - The number of copies there is of every document. Replicas.

When creating a database you can send your own values with request and
thereby overriding the defaults in ``default.ini``.

The number of copies of a document with the same revision that have to be read
before CouchDB returns with a ``200`` is equal to a half of total copies of
the document plus one. It is the same for the number of nodes that need to
save a document before a write is returned with ``201``. If there are less
nodes than that number, then ``202`` is returned. Both read and write numbers
can be specified with a request as ``r`` and ``w`` parameters accordingly.

We will focus on the shards and replicas for now.

A shard is a part of a database. The more shards, the more you can scale out.
If you have 4 shards, that means that you can have at most 4 nodes. With one
shard you can have only one node, just the way CouchDB 1.x is.

Replicas adds fail resistance, as some nodes can be offline without everything
comes crashing down.

* ``n=1`` All nodes must be up.
* ``n=2`` Any 1 node can be down.
* ``n=3`` Any 2 nodes can be down.
* etc

Computers go down and sysadmins pull out network cables in a furious rage from
time to time, so using ``n<2`` is asking for downtime. Having too high a value
of ``n`` adds servers and complexity without any real benefit. The sweet spot is
at ``n=3``.

Say that we have a database with 3 replicas and 4 shards. That would give us a
maximum of 12 nodes. 4*3=12 Every shard have 3 copies.

We can lose any 2 nodes and still read and write all documents.

What happens if we lose more nodes? It depends on how lucky we are. As long as
there is at least one copy of every shard online, we can read and write all
documents.

So, if we are very lucky then we can lose 8 nodes at maximum.
