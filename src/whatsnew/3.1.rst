* :ghissue:`2754`: Optimized compactor performance, resulting in a 40% speed improvement
  when document revisions approach the ``revs_limit``. The fixes also include additional
  metrics on size tracking during the sort and copy phases, accessible via the
  :get:`GET /_active_tasks </active_tasks>` endpoint.
