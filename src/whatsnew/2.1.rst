Version 2.1.0
=============

* The Mango ``_find`` endpoint supports a new combination operator,
  ``$allMatch``, which matches and returns all documents that contain an
  array field with all its elements matching all the specified query
  criteria.

* New scheduling replicator. The core of the new replicator is a
  scheduler which allows running a large number of replication
  jobs by switching between them, stopping some and starting others
  periodically. Jobs which fail are backed off exponentially. There is
  also an improved inspection and querying API: ``_scheduler/jobs`` and
  ``_scheduler/docs``:

  * ``_scheduler/jobs`` : This endpoint shows active replication
    jobs. These are jobs managed by the scheduler. Some of them might
    be running, some might be waiting to run, or backed off
    (penalized) because they crashed too many times. Semantically this
    is somewhat equivalent to ``_active_tasks`` but focuses only on
    replications. Jobs which have completed or which were never
    created because of malformed replication documents will not be
    shown here as they are not managed by the scheduler.
    ``_replicate`` replications, started form _replicate endpoint not
    from a document in a ``_replicator`` db, will also show up here.

  * ``_scheduler/docs`` : This endpoint is an improvement on having to go
    back and read replication documents to query their state. It
    represents the state of all the replications started from
    documents in _replicator db. Unlike ``_scheduler/jobs`` it will also
    show jobs which have failed or have completed.

  By default, scheduling replicator will not update documents with
  transient states like ``triggered`` or ``error`` anymore, instead
  ``_scheduler/docs`` API should be used to query replication document
  states.

Other scheduling replicator improvements
-----------------------------------------

  * Network resource usage and performance was improved by
    implementing a shared connection pool. This should help in cases
    of a large number of connections to the same sources or
    target. Previously connection pools were shared only withing a
    single replication job.

  * Improved request rate limit handling. Replicator requests will
    auto-discover rate limit capacity on targets and sources based on
    a proven Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease feedback
    control algorithm.

  * Improved performance by having exponential backoff for all
    replication jobs failures.  Previously there were some scenarios
    were failure led to continuous repeated retries, consuming CPU and
    disk resources in the process.

  * Improved recovery from long but temporary network
    failure. Currently if replications jobs fail to start 10 times in
    a row, they will not be retried anymore. This is sometimes
    desirable, but in some cases, for example, after a sustained DNS
    failure which eventually recovers, replications reach their retry
    limit, stop retrying and never recover. Previously it required
    user intervention to continue. Scheduling replicator will never
    give up retrying a valid scheduled replication job and so it
    should recover automatically.

  * Better handling of filtered replications. Failing user filter code
    fetches from the source will not block replicator manager and
    stall other replications. Failing filter fetches will also be
    backed off exponentially. Another improvement is when filter code
    changes on the source, a running replication will detect that and
    restart itself with a new replication ID automatically.

The 2.1.0 release also includes the following minor improvements:

  * :issue:`1946`: Hibernate couch_stream after each write (up to 70% reduction
    in memory usage during replication of DBs with large attachments)

.. _release/2.1.x/upgrade:

Upgrade Notes
=============

* The deprecated (and broken) OAuth 1.0 implementation has been removed.

* If user code reads or manipulates replicator document states,
  consider using the ``[replicator] update_docs = true`` compatibility
  parameter. In that case replicator will continue updating documents
  with transient replication states. However, that will incure a
  performance cost. Consider instead switching using
  ``_scheduler/docs`` HTTP endpoint.

* The ``stale`` parameter for views and _find has been deprecated in favour
  of two new parameters: ``stable`` and ``update``. The old ``stale=ok``
  behaviour is equivalent to ``stable=true&update=false``, and the old
  ``stale=update_after``behaviour is equivalent to ``stable=true&update=lazy``.
  The deprecated ``stale`` parameter will be removed in CouchDB 3.0.

* The ``[couchdb] max_document_size`` configuration parameter was renamed
  to ``[httpd] max_http_request_size`` to reflect its actual implementation.
  It has been enhanced by a new ``[couchdb] single_max_doc_size`` setting.
  Both are documented in the shipped ``default.ini`` file.
