=============

General
-------

* :ghissue:`1153`: Plugin based replicator authentication support. Session
  (cookie) based authentication implemented in the
  `couch_replicator_auth_session` plugin module. In this release session based
  authentication is considered experimental and is disabled by default. To
  enable set `[replicator] auth_plugins =
  couch_replicator_auth_session,couch_replicator_auth_noop`. Consider enabling
  it when using PBKDF2 or the new bcrypt password hashing algorithm with a
  large work factor.
