===========
Replication
===========

The replication is an incremental one way process involving two databases
(a source and a destination).

The aim of the replication is that at the end of the process, all active
documents on the source database are also in the destination database and all
documents that were deleted in the source databases are also deleted (if exists)
on the destination database.

The replication process only copies the last revision of a document, so all
previous revisions that were only on the source database are not copied to the
destination database.
