.. _fauxton/install:

============
Installation
============

Recent versions of `node.js`_ and `npm`_ are required.

.. _node.js: http://nodejs.org/
.. _npm: https://npmjs.org/doc/README.html

Get the source
==============

Clone the CouchDB repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/couchdb.git
    $ cd couchdb

Fauxton Setup
=============

Install all dependencies:

.. code-block:: none

    couchdb/ $ cd src/fauxton
    couchdb/src/fauxton/ $ npm install

.. note::
    To avoid a npm global install add ``node_modules/.bin`` to your path:

    .. code-block:: none

        export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH

    Or just use the wrappers in ``./bin/``.

    Development mode, non minified files:

    .. code-block:: none

        ./bin/grunt couchdebug

    Or fully compiled install:

    .. code-block:: none

        ./bin/grunt couchdb

Dev Server
==========

Using the dev server is the easiest way to use Fauxton, specially when
developing for it:

.. code-block:: none

    grunt dev

Deploy Fauxton
==============

Deploy Fauxton to your local CouchDB instance:

.. code-block:: none

    ./bin/grunt couchapp_deploy

The Fauxton be available by `/fauxton/_design/fauxton/index.html
<http://localhost:5984/fauxton/_design/fauxton/index.html>`_

Understanding Fauxton Code layout
---------------------------------

Each bit of functionality is its own separate module or addon.

All core modules are stored under `app/module` and any addons that are optional
are under `app/addons`.

We use `backbone.js`_ and `Backbone.layoutmanager`_ quite heavily, so best to
get an idea how they work. Its best at this point to read through a couple of
the modules and addons to get an idea of how they work.

Two good starting points are `app/addon/config` and `app/modules/databases`.

Each module must have a `base.js` file, this is read and compile when Fauxton is
deployed.

The `resource.js` file is usually for your ``Backbone.Models`` and
``Backbone.Collections``, `view.js` for your ``Backbone.Views``.

The `routes.js` is used to register a url path for your view along with what
layout, data, breadcrumbs and api point is required for the view.
