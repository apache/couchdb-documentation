Writing Addons
===============

Addons allow you to extend Fauxton for a specific use case. Usually, they
have the following structure:

.. code-block:: none

    + my_addon/
    | ---+ assets [optional]
    |    \ ---+ less
    |         \ ---- my_addon.less
    | ---+ templates/
    |    \ ---- my_addon.html - underscore template fragments
    | ---- resources.js - models and collections of the addon
    | ---- routes.js - URL routing for the addon
    | ---- views.js - views that the model provides

Generating an Addon
===================

We have a `grunt-init` template that lets you create a skeleton addon,
including all the boiler plate code. Run ``grunt-init tasks/addon`` and answer
the questions it asks to create an addon:

.. code-block:: none

    ± grunt-init tasks/addon
    path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.
    Running "addon" task

    Please answer the following:
    [?] Add on Name (WickedCool) SuperAddon
    [?] Location of add ons (app/addons)
    [?] Do you need an assets folder?(for .less) (y/N)
    [?] Do you need to make any changes to the above before continuing? (y/N)

    Created addon SuperAddon in app/addons

    Done, without errors.

Once the addon is created add the name to the settings.json file to get it
compiled and added on the next install.

Routes and hooks
================

An addon can insert itself into Fauxton in two ways; via a route or via a hook.

Routes
------

An addon will override an existing route should one exist, but in all other
ways is just a normal backbone `route/view`. This is how you would add a whole
new feature.

Hooks
-----

Hooks let you modify/extend an existing feature. They modify a DOM element by
selector for a named set of routes, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var Search = new FauxtonAPI.addon();
    Search.hooks = {
        // Render additional content into the sidebar
        "#sidebar-content": {
          routes:[
              "database/:database/_design/:ddoc/_search/:search",
              "database/:database/_design/:ddoc/_view/:view",
              "database/:database/_:handler"],
          callback: searchSidebar
        }
    };
    return Search;

adds the `searchSidebar` callback to `#sidebar-content` for three routes.

Hello world Addon
=================

First create the addon skeleton:

.. code-block:: none

    ± bbb addon
    path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.
    Running "addon" task

    Please answer the following:
    [?] Add on Name (WickedCool) Hello
    [?] Location of add ons (app/addons)
    [?] Do you need to make any changes to the above before continuing? (y/N)

    Created addon Hello in app/addons

    Done, without errors.

In `app/addons/hello/templates/hello.html` place:

.. code-block:: html

    <h1>Hello!</h1>

Next, we'll defined a simple view in `resources.js` (for more complex addons
you may want to have a views.js) that renders that template:

.. code-block:: javascript

    define([
        "app",
        "api"
    ],

    function (app, FauxtonAPI) {
        var Resources = {};

        Resources.Hello = FauxtonAPI.View.extend({
            template: "addons/hello/templates/hello"
        });

        return Resources;
    });

Then define a route in `routes.js` that the addon is accessible at:

.. code-block:: javascript

    define([
        "app",
        "api",
        "addons/hello/resources"
    ],

    function(app, FauxtonAPI, Resources) {
        var helloRoute = function () {
            console.log('helloRoute callback yo');
            return {
                layout: "one_pane",
                crumbs: [
                    {"name": "Hello","link": "_hello"}
                ],
                views: {
                    "#dashboard-content": new Resources.Hello({})
                },
                apiUrl: 'hello'
            };
        };

        Routes = {
            "_hello": helloRoute
        };

        return Routes;
    });

Then wire it all together in base.js:

.. code-block:: javascript

    define([
        "app",
        "api",
        "addons/hello/routes"
    ],

    function(app, FauxtonAPI, HelloRoutes) {
        var Hello = new FauxtonAPI.addon();
        console.log('hello from hello');

        Hello.initialize = function() {
            FauxtonAPI.addHeaderLink({title: "Hello", href: "#_hello"});
        };

        Hello.Routes = HelloRoutes;
        console.log(Hello);
        return Hello;
    });

Once the code is in place include the add on in your `settings.json` so that it
gets included by the `require` task. Your addon is included in one of three
ways; a local path, a git URL or a name. Named plugins assume the plugin is in
the Fauxton base directory, addons with a git URL will be cloned into the
application, local paths will be copied. Addons included from a local path will
be cleaned out by the clean task, others are left alone.
