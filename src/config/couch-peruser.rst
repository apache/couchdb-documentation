couch_peruser Options
=====================

.. config:section:: couch_peruser :: couch_peruser Options

    .. config:option:: enable

    If set to ``true``, couch_peruser ensures that a private per-user
    database exists for each document in ``_users``. These databases are
    writable only by the corresponding user. Databases are in the following
    form: ``userdb-{hex encoded username}``. ::

        [couch_peruser]
        enable = false

    .. note::
        The ``_users`` database must exist before couch_peruser can be enabled.

    .. config:option:: delete_dbs

    If set to ``true`` and a user is deleted, the respective database gets
    deleted as well. ::

        [couch_peruser]
        delete_dbs = false
        
    Note: When using jwt authorization, the provided token must include a custom _couchdb.roles=['_admin'] claim to for
    the peruser database to be properly created and accessible for the user provided in the sub= claim
