Cluster Options
===============

.. config:section:: cluster :: cluster Options

    .. config:option:: q

    Sets the default number of shards for newly created databases. The
    default value, ``8``, splits a database into 8 separate partitions. ::

        [cluster]
        q = 8

    For systems with lots of small, infrequently accessed databases, or
    for servers with fewer CPU cores, consider reducing this value to
    ``1`` or ``2``.

    The value of ``q`` can also be overridden on a per-DB basis, at DB
    creation time.

    .. seealso::
        httpdomain:put:`PUT /{db} </{db}>`

    .. config:option:: n

    Sets the number of replicas of each document in a cluster. CouchDB will
    only place one replica per node in a cluster. When set up through the
    :ref:`Cluster Setup Wizard <cluster/setup/wizard>`, a standalone single
    node will have ``n = 1``, a two node cluster will have ``n = 2``, and
    any larger cluster will have ``n = 3``. It is recommended not to set
    ``n`` greater than ``3``. ::

        [cluster]
        n = 3

    .. config:option:: placement

    Sets the cluster-wide replica placement policy when creating new
    databases. The value must be a comma-delimited list of strings of the
    format ``zone_name:#``, where ``zone_name`` is a zone as specified in
    the ``nodes`` database and ``#`` is an integer indicating the number of
    replicas to place on nodes with a matching ``zone_name``.

    This parameter is not specified by default. ::

        [cluster]
        placement = metro-dc-a:2,metro-dc-b:1

        :ref:`cluster/databases/placement`
