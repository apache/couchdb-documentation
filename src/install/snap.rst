Installation via Snap
=====================

Apache CouchDB provides 'convenience binary' Snap builds through the
Ubuntu snapcraft repository under the name ``couchdb``. Only snaps built
from official stable CouchDB releases (``2.0``, ``2.1``, etc.) are available
through this channel.

After `installing snapd`_, the CouchDB snap can be installed via::

    $ sudo snap install couchdb

CouchDB will be installed at ``/snap/couchdb``. Data will be stored at
``/var/snap/couchdb/``.

Further details on the snap build process are available in our
`couchdb-pkg git repository`_.
